# Learning log: M14 (Home is the library)

Written for Samuel and for the next Claude session. One iteration per
attempt judged by a signal: a test run, a CI run, a review, a measurement,
a look at a screenshot, or Samuel's verdict. Plain English; numbers are
quoted from the tool output named, with the commit they ran on.

Outcomes: **success** (the hypothesis held), **failure** (it did not),
**partial**, **flake** (failure not caused by the change; evidence given),
**dead end** (abandoned; why).

## Index

| # | When (UTC) | Step | Hypothesis or goal | Signal | Outcome | Lesson (short) |

## Lessons so far

Rules learned in this milestone, each with the iterations that taught it
and how to apply it. A lesson seen twice moves to the top.

## Iterations

### Iteration 1 · 2026-10-05 19:55 · Baseline · success

**Hypothesis.** `main` (deb0924, plus only docs in 0a43836) is green on the
Mac before any M14 code changes, apart from the known CI-only WebKit
failure (`readalong.spec.ts:727`, build plan §11).
**Action.** On branch `m14-b1-availability` at 0a43836 (docs only on top of
`main`): `npm run check`; then `rm -rf .data/e2e .data/e2e-files && npx
playwright test --ignore-snapshots`.
**Evaluation.** The two summary lines.
**Result.** `npm run check`: lint and types clean, `Test Files 60 passed |
1 skipped (61)`, `Tests 342 passed | 2 skipped (344)`, exit 0. Browser
suite: `Running 219 tests using 9 workers` → `219 passed (6.2m)`, exit 0.
**Interpretation.** A green start on the Mac: any later failure comes from
M14 changes (or a collision), not from `main`. The known WebKit failure
at `readalong.spec.ts:727` did not occur here; it is CI-only so far.
**Lesson.** None new; this is the reference point.
**Next experiment.** Step 1 (`m14-b1-availability`).
