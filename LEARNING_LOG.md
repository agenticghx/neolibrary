# Learning log: M14 (Home is the library)

Written for Samuel and for the next Claude session. One iteration per
attempt judged by a signal: a test run, a CI run, a review, a measurement,
a look at a screenshot, or Samuel's verdict. Plain English; numbers are
quoted from the tool output named, with the commit they ran on.

Outcomes: **success** (the hypothesis held), **failure** (it did not),
**partial**, **flake** (failure not caused by the change; evidence given),
**dead end** (abandoned; why).

## Index

| # | When (UTC) | Step | Hypothesis or goal | Signal | Outcome | Lesson (short) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-10-05 19:55 | Baseline | `main` is green on the Mac | `npm run check`; full browser suite | success | start from green |
| 2 | 2026-10-05 20:10 | 1 | Labels by availability, no "owned", suites stay green | `npm run check`; full browser suite on f530c5d | success | a required prop turns a forgotten call site into a type error |
| 3 | 2026-10-05 20:25 | 1 | The step-1 change is ready (review) | three reviewer agents | partial | reviews found test gaps the plan's own mutation list missed |
| 4 | 2026-10-05 20:35 | 1 | Each rule has a test that fails when it breaks | 6 unit mutations + 1 browser mutation with a control run | success | mutate every branch of a rule, not only the ones the plan lists |
| 5 | 2026-10-05 20:45 | 1 | The reviewed commit stays green | full browser run on 281bf04 | success | rerun the whole suite after review fixes |
| 6 | 2026-10-05 20:36 | 1 | CI on draft PR #73 checks 9bbf122 | CI run 37369213583 | flake | read a job's step count before reading its result |
| 7 | 2026-10-05 21:10 | 1 | Only the planned reference images differ on CI | CI rerun of 37369213583 | success | an unchanged image can still pass the 0.2% limit |

## Lessons so far

Rules learned in this milestone, each with the iterations that taught it
and how to apply it. A lesson seen twice moves to the top.

- **Ask "which bug passes every test?", then mutate it** (Iterations 3, 4).
  The plan's three mutation checks all passed, yet a reviewer found three
  more bugs no test caught (a broken `isAvailable`, the uploaded-audiobook
  path in the data and on the shelf). Apply: for each rule, break each
  branch once, not only the cases the plan names.
- **Turn "every caller must…" into a required parameter** (Iteration 2).
  The compiler then lists every call site. Apply to the Home grid and
  spines in step 3 (they draw covers too).
- **A browser mutation can run in about two minutes**: build the mutated
  app, serve it on the database a full run left, run one test with
  `--no-deps`, then a control run on the restored code (Iteration 4,
  scratchpad `m7.sh`).

## Iterations

### Iteration 1 · 2026-10-05 19:55 · Baseline · success

**Hypothesis.** `main` (deb0924, plus only docs in 0a43836) is green on the
Mac before any M14 code changes, apart from the known CI-only WebKit
failure (`readalong.spec.ts:727`, build plan §11).
**Action.** On branch `m14-b1-availability` at 0a43836 (docs only on top of
`main`): `npm run check`; then `rm -rf .data/e2e .data/e2e-files && npx
playwright test --ignore-snapshots`.
**Evaluation.** The two summary lines.
**Result.** `npm run check`: lint and types clean, `Test Files 60 passed |
1 skipped (61)`, `Tests 342 passed | 2 skipped (344)`, exit 0. Browser
suite: `Running 219 tests using 9 workers` → `219 passed (6.2m)`, exit 0.
**Interpretation.** A green start on the Mac: any later failure comes from
M14 changes (or a collision), not from `main`. The known WebKit failure
at `readalong.spec.ts:727` did not occur here; it is CI-only so far.
**Lesson.** None new; this is the reference point.
**Next experiment.** Step 1 (`m14-b1-availability`).

### Iteration 2 · 2026-10-05 20:10 · Step 1 · success

**Hypothesis.** Labelling titles by availability (D1, narration counts) and
removing "owned" keeps every suite green; only the four reference images
for the changed pages differ (CI only).
**Action.** `lib/library/availability.ts`; Cover takes a required
`available` (a forgotten call site is now a type error, advisor's idea);
Path view, shelf, book page, `/design`, reader guard; tests reworded
(commit f530c5d).
**Evaluation.** `npm run check`; `rm -rf .data/e2e .data/e2e-files && npx
playwright test --ignore-snapshots`; the wording grep.
**Result.** `Tests 353 passed | 2 skipped (355)` (11 new); browser `219
passed (6.2m)`, exit 0; `grep -rniE "not owned|books you own|unowned|\bowned\b"
app components lib e2e --exclude-dir=__screenshots__` prints nothing.
**Interpretation.** Behaviour holds on the Mac. Reference images were not
compared (`--ignore-snapshots`); four sets will fail on CI as planned.
**Lesson.** Make "every caller must do X" a required parameter so the
compiler lists the callers, instead of a warning in a plan.
**Next experiment.** Reviews (Iteration 3).

### Iteration 3 · 2026-10-05 20:25 · Step 1 review · partial

**Hypothesis.** f530c5d is ready to push.
**Action.** Three read-only reviewer agents: correctness and regressions;
wording, UI and contrast; "could each test fail?". Findings checked by
reading the code or by a mutation run (a direct check stood in for a
skeptic agent where one was possible).
**Result.** Confirmed and fixed (281bf04): a broken `isAvailable` (read AND
listen) passed every test; the uploaded-audiobook path in `getPathView`,
`getBook` and the shelf was untested; no test read the shelf label;
"Your shelf" small heading over "Your library"; available titles in a
Path's folded list had no label; Cover imported server code (database,
ElevenLabs) through `availability.ts`; `docs/design.md` used old names.
Not changed, with reasons: reference images stale (refreshed from CI, §8);
screen readers hear "not available yet" in the link name and the caption
(both required by the plan's tests; harmless); `getBook` does one extra
query for pages that ignore the label (one query, not per row); the label
ignores the voice spending cap (D1 says key set = narration on); "Listen
only" titles have nowhere to play (D2, not in M14). Contrast of all new
labels: lowest 6.86:1 (sepia, sunken panel).
**Lesson.** The plan's mutation list covered the rules it named; a
reviewer asking "which bug passes every test?" found three more.
**Next experiment.** Mutation-check the new tests (Iteration 4).

### Iteration 4 · 2026-10-05 20:35 · Step 1 mutations · success

**Hypothesis.** Each availability rule has a test that fails when the rule
breaks.
**Action.** A script (scratchpad `mutate.py`) applies one change, runs the
named Vitest files, restores the file. On 281bf04's code.
**Result.** All caught: M1 `audiobookBookIds` ignores `status` → 2 failed
(availability.test, paths.test); M2 narration counts for a PDF → 1 failed
("never counts narration for a PDF"); M3 Cover shows the image for a
title-only book → 1 failed; M4 `isAvailable` = read AND listen → 2 failed
(Cover "can only be read", paths.test); M5 `getPathView` ignores uploaded
audiobooks → 1 failed; M6 `getBook` ignores them → 1 failed. M7 (shelf page
ignores uploaded audiobooks): built the mutated app, served it on the
database the full run left, ran only `readalong.spec.ts:1123` with
`--no-deps` (scratchpad `m7.sh`) → `1 failed` at line 1154 ("Read and
listen" not found on the PDF's shelf item); control on the restored code →
`1 passed (25.2s)`.
**Lesson.** See Iteration 3.
**Next experiment.** Draft PR; CI; refresh the reference images from CI.

### Iteration 5 · 2026-10-05 20:45 · Step 1 · success

**Hypothesis.** The review fixes (281bf04) keep every suite green,
including the new browser checks (shelf and book-page labels, a PDF with
an audiobook says Read and listen).
**Action.** `npm run check` (before commit); `rm -rf .data/e2e
.data/e2e-files && npx playwright test --ignore-snapshots` on 281bf04.
**Result.** `npm run lint`, `tsc` clean; browser `219 passed (6.2m)`, exit 0.
**Interpretation.** Ready for a draft PR. CI will still fail four
reference-image sets (`book-not-available`, `path`, `shelf-empty`,
`design`), which the Mac run does not compare.
**Lesson.** None new.
**Next experiment.** Push as a draft; read CI.

### Iteration 6 · 2026-10-05 20:36 · Step 1 CI · flake

**Hypothesis.** CI on PR #73 (9bbf122) passes everything except the four
reference-image sets.
**Action.** Pushed, opened draft PR #73.
**Evaluation.** `gh pr checks 73`; `gh run view 37369213583 --json jobs`.
**Result.** Three jobs "fail" after 15m1s, but each is `cancelled` with
`steps=0`: they never got a runner. Only the ledger check ran (pass).
githubstatus.com at 20:36 UTC: "Partially Degraded Service", Actions
`degraded_performance`, "Incident with Actions: investigating".
**Interpretation.** Not a test result: no code was tested on CI. A flake of
the service, with evidence.
**Lesson.** A red check is not a test failure until its log shows steps;
check `steps` (or the log) before reading anything into it.
**Next experiment.** `gh run rerun 37369213583 --failed`; wait.

### Iteration 7 · 2026-10-05 21:10 · Step 1 CI · success (images refreshed)

**Hypothesis.** On CI only the reference images of the changed pages fail.
**Action.** `gh run rerun 37369213583 --failed` after the outage; read the
browser job log; `gh run download 37369213583 -n playwright-report`.
**Result.** Browser job ran (13 steps): `10 failed`, `122 did not run`,
`87 passed (3.0m)`. All 10 failures are `visual.spec.ts` "looks as
approved": `path` (4 looks), `shelf-empty` (4), `book-not-available`
(phone light and dark). Looked at each `*-actual.png`: the Path page with
"Not available yet" under every cover, "Your library" under "LIBRARY", the
book page's "Not available yet. Add the book file…". Copied the 10 into
`e2e/__screenshots__`. `design` passed: its covers are below the fold.
**Interpretation.** As planned. The 122 tests that did not run sit behind
the screenshot projects; they run on the next push.
**Lesson.** `book-not-available` on desktop passed although its text
changed: a one-line text change can stay under the 0.2% pixel limit, so
the old reference image stays. Step 2 refreshes every signed-in image.
**Next experiment.** Push; all checks green; mark ready; merge.
